# npm install global
```batch

```
# pip(python install program)
pip can download it with python download.
example:
```batch
pip install [program name]
```
`pip` is the program name.
`install` is the function of program. (some program function **`i`** is meaning for **`install`**, but pip **`i`** is *not a function meaning for **`install`.***)
# install program run(sudo, default install)
```batch
sudo install [program name]
echo next
install [program name]
```
1. sudo install
   `sudo install` command needs to insert a password.
   the error message is:
   ```plaintext
   usage: install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]
               [-o owner] file1 file2
       install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]
               [-o owner] file1 ... fileN directory
       install -d [-v] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] directory ...
   ```
   and i can't do it myself see you a right message.
2. install
   `install` command is similar to `sudo install` command.
   that needs to insert the password.
   errror message is same as the `sudo install` error message.
   i didn't do this command, so i didn't know it.
# text print
```batch
echo lorem Ipsum!
echo "lorem Ipsum!"
```
`echo` command is an basic code that print any text like `echo [any text]`
this code prints same `lorem Ipsum!`. the text that has any space needs quotes in default, `echo` not needs any quotes.
# npm default install + new version install
```batch
npm install [program name]
```
is an default install code.
```batch
npm install [program name]@next
```
is an new version install code.
`npm` is an program name.
`install` is an function name(`i` function meaning this)
`@next` function is an new version install(up for version 2.0) code.
